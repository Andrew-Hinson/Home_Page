    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div id="bio">
    <p>Thank you for taking an interest and looking at my site! First things first, I am a Baton Rouge native and resident.<br>
       I have been learning and practicing web development technologies for the past year. I am extremely interested and passionate about<br>
       coding, and while I understand that is an all encompassing term, every moment in the past few months that I am not at work, I spend in front of a computer,
       learning as much as I can. I do not pretend to know it all, in fact, I'll be the first to say, if I do not have an answer this second, let me take a shot at it,
       and I will have an answer for you. The main technologies I have learned (and am still learning) are the obvious;
       <ul>
           <li>HTML</li>
           <li>CSS</li>
           <li>JavaScript</li>
       </ul>
       With most of my time spent on JavaScript, you may find that my styling is not the most flashy. This is something I <i>CAN</i> work on,<br>
       however it is also my understanding that styling at firms is mostly set or handled by specialized UX designers.<br>
       With that being said, I want to be a master of everything I touch, getting there or being useful to a company is my top priority.<br>
       Therefore, JavaScript is my main priority. Currently I am working through a 60+ hour online bootcamp course (which translates to maybe triple that amount of study time).
       Technologies I am currently learning are;
       <ul>
           <li>Node JS</li>
           <li>Express</li>
           <li>Mongo DB</li>
       </ul>
